        <div class="paragraph">This project was done as part of a CBL course (Community Based Learning). The goal of this project was to thouroghly research a topic on how they impact U.S. presidential elections. I created an infographic on public broadcasting and talked about the history of public broadcasting and it's impact on elections. These info graphics where printed out and glued to foam board, I also created 3-D pop out elements with my info bubbles. These infographics were then hung up in a gallery during the week of the 2024 presidential election.</div>
