        <div class="projectname">CBL Propaganda Poster</div>
        <div class="paragraph">This was another Community Based Learning project. For this project we were tasked to make a creative project based on a topic provided to us by the professor. My topic was public airwaves so I began researching the FCC and I kept seeing a term or slogan "To best serve the public interest" which to me sounded like propaganda slogans on posters, something akin to "I want you" on the iconin Uncle Sam poster. I used a lot of imagery and colors from communist propaganda posters which is why is looks similar to those styles of posters.</div>
