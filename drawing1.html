        <div class="paragraph">This was the first drawing in a series I did for a class. My series was horror centric exploring things like monsters and body horror, for this drwing specifically I chose to depict a creature emerging from a tumorus looking cacoon. I added a sort of network of similar looking cacoons attached to the main one to make them feel more hive like. I also made the figure itself very gaunt and screaming to depict that emerging from this cacoon is a painful experience. I also wanted to do the whole series in black and white with minimal shading to really work on my line work.  </div>
