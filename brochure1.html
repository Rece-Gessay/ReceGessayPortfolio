        <div class="projectname">UNESCO Brochure</div>
        <div class="paragraph">This was one of my more successful parts of my UNESCO project. We had been tasked with making a brochure for our chosen UNESCO site, this brochure has to include the site name, logo, map of site, images from the site, UNESCO signifigance, and any necessary information about the site. If you look at the logo style guide you can see what pattern elements I used to create a theme for my brochures. Once finished with the design we then had to print out the brochures so we have physical copies to handout when presenting the final project. This brochure took me one weekend, roughly 15 hours total but I'd say it was worth it becuase it was one of the parts of this project that I was felt most accomplished about.</div>
