        <div class="paragraph">This was the third drawing in the same series as the cacoon drawing where I was exploring drawing creatures and body horror, this one really leaned into the body horror I was looking for. I wanted the try and capture the face muscles underneath the skin and I think while not super realistic I feel like I was able to capture that kind of stringy muscley texture. I also think I did exceptionally well with the hard peeling the skin off. I personally think that this was my favorite drawing out of the series I did for this class.</div>
