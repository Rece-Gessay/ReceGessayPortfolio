        <div class="paragraph">One of the very first parts of the UNESCO project was to make a logo for your selected UNESCO World Heritage site. These logos went through many weeks of critiques and revisions likely because it was the most important aspect of the project. Once we were satisfied with a logo design we were then tasked to create a styleguide for this logo. This styleguide had to include the main logo design, 15 different color variations of the logo, pantones for each color used in the main logo, the font used, and additional design elements like patterns, icons, and inspiration.</div>
