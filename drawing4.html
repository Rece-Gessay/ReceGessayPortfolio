        <div class="paragraph">This was a drawing that I did for fun more or less, I had recently read through all 5 issues of the Last Ronin comic book and I couldn't stop looking back at the cover of the comic so I decided to do a drawing of it. The figure is heavily based off of Ben Bishop's artwork for the cover of The Last Ronin, but to change the drawing up from basically a copy I looked back at the original 1984 TMNT comics which had this black and white rough, grimy kinda cross hatching style that I tried to emulate when doing the inking for this piece. I also wanted to add the red moon in the back round for various reasons like it being a prominent aspect from the cover, the red being a call back to the turtles all originally wearing red bandanas which also ties in with the mystery of what turtle is the last ronin, and finally it looks extremely similar to the Japan flag which is a prominent place in this story.</div>
