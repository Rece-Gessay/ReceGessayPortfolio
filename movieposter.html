        <div class="projectname">TMNT Movie Poster (1990 Movie)</div>
        <div class="paragraph">This is one of my earliest graphic design projects from college. We were tasked with making a movie poster of a film we loved as a kid, initially I had chosen Space Balls because me and my friends would watch it all the time at sleepovers, but i was really struggling with coming up with an illustrated poster for Space Balls. So I turned to another movie I loved growing up and that was the 1990 TMNT movie, I watched this movie so much I could quote most of the movie. For the design I outlined Shredder's mask and gave him the red skyscraper background to represent his grasp on the city in this moive, I also wanted to have the colors of this postr to be back, white, and red to represent the colors of the original comics the film is based off of which is also where the pose for the turtles came from, it's the same pose from the cover of their very first comic issue. Finally I added the modern logo as the title just for brand synergy.</div>
