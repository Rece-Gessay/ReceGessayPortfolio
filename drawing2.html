        <div class="paragraph">For this drawing I was tasked to do "something abstract" which I initially had struggled with. So I took to the internet to do some research and stumbled across some images of bismuth crystals, they were very geometric with super interesting patterns, so that became the inspiration for this drawing. I started by making a bunch of square and rectangular shapes following the path of the "golden curve". I then began to create swirly and wavy patterns within some of the shapes and left others blank to have some contrast. Finally I put everything into one large rectangle.</div>
